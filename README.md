Created by [Joe Domaleski](https://blog.marketingdatascience.ai), July 2025.

This project contains R scripts and synthetic datasets that demonstrate how to use confusion matrices to evaluate email marketing models.

It includes two examples:
1. **Balanced Dataset** ‚Äî A simplified example with roughly equal open and non-open rates, ideal for introducing confusion matrix concepts.
2. **Unbalanced Dataset** ‚Äî A more realistic marketing scenario where email open rates are low, showing the challenges of class imbalance.

## üìÇ Files Included
- `generate_synthetic_datasets.R` ‚Äî R script to create and save both balanced and unbalanced synthetic datasets.
- `balanced-vs-unbalanced-data-example-email-opens.R` - R script to create bar plots of the datasets for the blog article.
- `evaluate_confusion_matrix.R` ‚Äî Main R script to:
  - Load datasets.
  - Run logistic regression.
  - Generate confusion matrices and key performance metrics.
- `synthetic_email_data_balanced.csv` ‚Äî Synthetic dataset with balanced classes.
- `synthetic_email_data_unbalanced.csv` ‚Äî Synthetic dataset with unbalanced classes (low open rate).

## üîç Key Concepts Covered
- Confusion matrix analysis
- Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and balanced accuracy
- The impact of class imbalance on model evaluation
- Logistic regression for binary classification in marketing
